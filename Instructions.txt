Connect to Ubuntu Server

ssh -X <USERNAME>ec2-52-42-229-104.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
//-X allows for x11 redirection, a GUI can’t run on the terminal so we redirect it to our computer to run, after connecting
try xclock

Using Git
In the directory you want the project to be in, git init
git clone https://github.com/JayJayEvans/WaterBase.git
cd WaterBase
git pull https://github.com/JayJayEvans/WaterBase.git

Important Prerequisite to run the program! This does not persist unless you put it in your bash profile so do so
export CLASSPATH=.:mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar


Using Mysql
I’ve configured a .my.cnf file on both of your home directories, it contains login information for mysql, so all you have 
to do is type mysql into the command line and you’ll automatically connect. Keep in mind we’ll be sharing this database 
so be careful with changes.
